This repository containts the files used to implement the Feasibility Pump, decribed in the following paper:
Fischetti, M., Glover, F. & Lodi, A. The feasibility pump. Math. Program. 104, 91â€“104 (2005). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-004-0570-3

The first implementation will be done in Python.
Future implementations will be done in C in order to help run the algorithm faster as it can require vast resources due to the nature of the Pump. 

The first implementation deals with (0, 1)-LPs and future implementations would strive to encapsulate the solutions of a general MIP.
